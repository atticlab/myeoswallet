            this blockchain.</p>

          <p class="">The Members grant the right of contract and of private property to each other, therefore no

          <h4>Article XV - Termination of Agreement</h4>
          <p class="">A Member is automatically released from all revocable obligations under this Constitution 3 years after the last transaction signed by that Member is incorporated into the blockchain.
